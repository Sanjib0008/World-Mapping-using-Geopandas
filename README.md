This basic example will show how to plot a world map, color countries by a specific attribute, and customize the appearance.

## Explanation of the Code 

Load Data: world loads a GeoDataFrame containing country boundaries and attributes like population and GDP.

Plot Basic Map: world.plot() provides a simple map, showing the outline of countries.

Color by Attribute: Using the column parameter, countries are colored based on an attribute like 'pop_est' (population estimate).

Add Borders and Adjust Colors: The boundary plot adds clear country borders, and adjusting cmap changes the color scheme for visual emphasis.

This example covers basic world mapping with geopandas. You can add further customizations, such as zooming into specific regions, overlaying additional layers, or creating interactive maps if needed.
